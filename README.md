### Hi there, my name is Francesco ðŸ‘‹

Full Stack Web Developer at <a href="https://www.between.tech/">Between Technology</a>.
I am from Italy, currently living in Malaga, Spain and I write code to solve problems ðŸ’».

<h3>About me</h3>

Making the leap from bar and restaurant managing to coding was a wild ride, but now I'm loving every minute as a Full Stack Developer in sunny MÃ¡laga, Spain!

With over 3 years of experience, I'm fluent in Front-End sorcery with React.js and Typescript, and I've got some nifty Backend skills too.

I thrive on problem-solving and creating smiles for users. Collaboration is where the magic happens, and I'm always eager to dive into the latest tech trends. Let's join forces and craft some exceptional software together! ðŸš€
